# CollabEdit2.0
The main purpose of this project is to manage consistency, maintenance and concurrency control in collaborative editing of text documents of different formats using the concept of <b>“Operational Transformation”</b>.
<br>It allows two individuals to edit same file simultaneously, who are connected through Internet. It supports do, undo, edit and document sharing. 

Collaborative writing is writing done by more than one person; they may discuss what they are going to write before they start, and discuss what they have written after they finish each draft they write. The writing might be organized by dividing the writing into sub-tasks assigned to each group member, with the first part of the tasks done before the next parts, or they might work together on each task. The writing is planned, written, and revised, and more than one person is involved in at least one of those steps. Usually, discussions about the document's structure and context involve the entire group. The product is designed to be a multi user product. It allows multiple users with editing privileges to edit the shared document simultaneously once user/users are authenticated for required access
